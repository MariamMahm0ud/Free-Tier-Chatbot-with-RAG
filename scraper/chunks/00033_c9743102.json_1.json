  "text": "(about) “You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.” by Bob Marley (about) “I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living.” by Dr. Seuss (about) “I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.” by Douglas Adams (about) “The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.” by Elie Wiesel (about) “It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.” by Friedrich Nietzsche (about) “Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.” by Mark Twain (about) “Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.” by Allen Saunders (about)",
