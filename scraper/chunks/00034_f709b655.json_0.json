  "text": "“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” by Dr. Seuss (about) “We read to know we're not alone.” by William Nicholson (about) “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.” by George R.R. Martin (about) “You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.” by C.S. Lewis (about) “What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.” by J.D. Salinger (about) “′Classic′ - a book which people praise and don't read.” by Mark Twain (about) “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” by Jane Austen (about)",
