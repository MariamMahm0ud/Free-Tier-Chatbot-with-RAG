Lewis (about) “If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.” by Haruki Murakami (about) “There is no friend as loyal as a book.” by Ernest Hemingway (about) “What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.” by J.D. Salinger (about) “′Classic′ - a book which people praise and don't read.” by Mark Twain (about) “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” by Jane Austen (about) “You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.” by Madeleine L'Engle (about)",
