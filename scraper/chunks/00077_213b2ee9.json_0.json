  "text": "“There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” by Ernest Hemingway (about) “What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.” by J.D. Salinger (about) “You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.” by Madeleine L'Engle (about)",
