  "text": "Viewing tag: love “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.” by C.S. Lewis (about) “If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever.” by Alfred Tennyson (about) “A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.” by Jane Austen (about) “To die will be an awfully big adventure.” by J.M. Barrie (about)",
